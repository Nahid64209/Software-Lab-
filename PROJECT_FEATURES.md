## T-1: Implement Admin/User Signup Page
This feature includes a signup form with logo, name, email, password, confirm password, and user type (Admin/User). Validation is handled for unique email, password strength, matching passwords, and required fields. On successful signup, user data is saved, a confirmation email is sent, and the user is redirected to the dashboard.
